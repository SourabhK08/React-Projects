# Context API

1. Create a context folder and make UserContext.js file by using createContext() function.

```Javascript
<UserContext>
    <Login />
    <Card>
        <RightComp />
    </Card>
</UserContext>
```

2. UserContext is just like a global variable , we've to wrap our components by it. For wrapping up components now we've to make UserContextProvider.jsx
